# Introduction to trees

A data structure that consists of nodes in a `parent/child` relationships.
Trees have `root` (parent) top most node and have `subparents` and `children` as well.
<br>

- Trees are `non-linear` data structures that contain a root and child nodes
- Binary Trees can have values of any type, but at most two children for each parent
- Binary Search Trees are a more specific version of binary trees where every node to the left of a parent is less than its value and every node to the right is greater
- We can search through trees using `BFS` and `DFS`

## Tree Terminology

- Root: the top node in a tree
- Child: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
- Parent: The converse notion of a child
- Siblings: A group of nodes with the same parent
- Leaf: A node with no children
- Edge: The connection between one node and another
