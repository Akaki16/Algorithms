# Priority Queue

A data structure where each element has a priority. elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.

## Priority Queue pseudocode

- Write a `MinBinaryHeap`: lower numbers means higher priority
- Each node has a value and a priority, use the priority to build the heap
- Enqueue method accepts a value and a priority, makes a new node, and puts it in the right spot based off of its priority
- Dequeue methods removes root element, returns it, and rearranges heap using priority
