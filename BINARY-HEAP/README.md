# Binary Heap (Tree data structure)

Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules! In a `MaxBinaryHeap`, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a `MinBinaryHeap`, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.

Binary Heaps are used to implement `Priority Queues` which are very commonly used data structures.
