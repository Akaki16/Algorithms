# Binary Heap (Tree data structure)

Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules! In a `MaxBinaryHeap`, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a `MinBinaryHeap`, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.
<br>

Binary Heaps are used to implement `Priority Queues` which are very commonly used data structures.

## Big O of Binary Heaps

- Insertion: `O(log n)`
- Removal: `O(log n)`
- Search: `O(log n)`
  <br>

- Binary Heaps are very useful data structures for sorting, and implementing other data structures like `priority queues`
- Binary Heaps are either `MaxBinaryHeaps` or `MinBinaryHeaps` with parents either being smaller or larger than their children
- With just a little bit of math, we can represent heaps using arrays
